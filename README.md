it's a great game, trust us.

uses the following tech:
	node for web server base
	express for routing
	socket.io for client/server communication
	ES6 stuff (imports, classes)

to run:
	clone this repo, and yiboduan and jayme
	in yiboduan root run `node app.js` except to run it on a port that isn't 80 you'll need to change the port variable in `app.js`
